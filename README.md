# Rail Placement Fix

Rail Placement Fix is a Minecraft mod that allows you to place rails more precisely. By sneaking and looking at the corner of a block, you can place curved rails or place sloped rails like a top-side slab. This mod enables you to create any rail pattern you like without changing the shape of neighboring rails.

## Features

- Place curved rails by sneaking and looking at the corner of a block.
- Place sloped rails like a top-side slab.
